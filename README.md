## Generative Multi Layer Perceptron ðŸ¤– 

This is a simple Generative MLP for time series learning and generation. Written using Numpy, and presenting many interesting ideas. 
The loss function is totally custom, and learning schedule is hard-coded for now. This will be updated.

Weights are initialized using He-et-al Initialization. 

Training process involves adding uniform noise to input data, to help generalize and increase robustness. 

âœ… For now you can train the model on a CPU in a couple of minutes and see the example data generated. 

ðŸš« The weight saving and loading needs to be repaired.
