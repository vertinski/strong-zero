#Generative Multi Layer Perceptron ðŸ¤– 

This is a simple, custom written, Generative MLP for time series learning and generation. 
The loss function is totally custom and learning schedule is hard coded as of now. This will be updated.
Training process involves adding uniform noise to input data, to help generalize and increase robustness. 

âœ… For now you can train the model on a CPU in a couple of minutes and see the example data generated. 
ðŸš« The weight saving and loading needs to be repaired.
